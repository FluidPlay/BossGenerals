Boss Generals R3 Remaster
=========================
** Release 3 - RM

* I - Intro:
------------
- Thank you for downloading and playing Command and Conquer™ Boss Generals. This is the result of countless man-hours of passionate and dedicated design discussions, art, and balance play sessions, by some of the best in the CnC community. Please check the included "manual" subfolder in the provided zip file for full details on the units and gameplay of the mod. Please read any "Boss R* changes.txt" file, for details of changes in the new version.

** There are no balance changes in R3 Remaster compared to the stable 2005 R3 Release, focus was on graphics enhancements


* II - Install Steps:
---------------------

II.a - Compatibility - Boss Generals R3 Remaster is compatible with the Zero Hour patch 1.04. It hasn't been tested with Zero Hour patch 1.05, but it's supposed to have multiplayer compatibility. Please report any issues with it.

II.b - Clean up - Before installing, make sure you have a clean C&C Generals: Zero Hour install. You can get it from Steam, it's included in the "C&C Ultimate Collection" pack at a very affordable price (https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/Command__Conquer_Generals_Zero_Hour/). Please Remove any other mods or third party maps/shellmaps you might have. If you run into any problems please head to the technical support section in our forums, or send a message in our Discord (link below).

II.c - GenPatcher - Install the amazing "GenPatcher" tool (https://legi.cc/genpatcher/), click on "Apply Fixes" then "Install GenTool" (required for Boss UI). 

II.c - Installation - To install, simply unzip the whole contents of this ZIP file to the main Zero Hour folder (depends on the package you have, commonly C:\Program Files\EA Games\Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour).

II.d - Running - Run the game as usual, preferably the "Command & Conquer Generals Zero Hour Windowed" desktop icon to prevent some Alt+Tab issues.

II.e - Additional Information / FAQ
	
	- Does BossGens Remaster support ultrawide monitors? 
	A: Not properly, Boss UI currently supports only widescreen formats. It will still run in ultrawide resolutions, and present less horizontal distortion/stretching than the default UI.

	- Does it have an AI mode?
	A: You bet, the AI is custom tailored for BossGens gameplay. Be challenged to face the ultimate "Boss Hard" AI mode and fasten your seatbelt! PS: I must practice more, haven't beaten it in a while..

	- Does it have regular single player mission?
	A: Only the default Zero Hour missions are included, and they're not supported so you might find errors when trying to play it. For single player action a default C&C Generals: Zero Hour installation is recommended.

	- Can I play it online?
	A: Indeed. There are many ways to play it online, check GenPatcher's "Playing Online" tab, enable the "Network optimizations" option at the ack. Out of the three options, the "Radmin VPN" option is the best one with practically no lag, while you will find more games using GameRanger. When creating games, make sure to add the *BossGens* tag at the game name, so people know it's a mod-specific lobby.	
	
		* Like for standard Zero Hour play, for proper Boss Generals online play it's recommended that you have the following TCP ports open in your router/firewall: TCP 80, 6667, 28910, 29900, 29920; UDP 4321, 27900.

* IV - Uninstalling:
--------------------

Before installing CnC Boss Generals R3 Remaster, please create a backup of your Zero Hour installation folder. Restore/Rename it to revert back to standard Zero Hour gameplay.


* V. International Support:
---------------------------

a. Boss Generals supports all language versions of CnC Generals:Zero Hour (English, Brazilian, German, Korean, Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese and Polish), untranslated from English. Simply move the included Data/English folder contents to your language subfolder (Eg: Data/German). Specifically translated versions are planned, by demand.

AI Tools have been used, non exclusively, for the development of the 4k Remastered version of Boss Generals. All the original Boss Generals art was hand-crafted by the mod author in the early 2000s, and all the 2024-2025 upscaling was scrutinized and heavily manually edited to assure the best possible quality. There was absolutely *no* sloppiness involved.

Known Issues: (will be fixed)
