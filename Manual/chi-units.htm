        Original Inferno Cannons, although less cumbersome than Nuke Cannons, 
        had such a slow moving projectile that they could rarely fulfill their 
        anti-infantry role. Add to that the high technology requirements to build 
        them (Propaganda Center), and you might as well give these detractors 
        complete reasoning. General Kang, a well known lover of fire weapons, 
        wasn't shy at all when he personally projected the brand new Inferno MK2. 
        With increased turret pressure, faster reload and good firestorm-creation 
        abilities, his fire launcher technical components were also simplified 
        to make their assembling possible in standard War Factories.</p>
