      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Boss 
        Generals for <i>Command and Conquer&#153; Generals Zero Hour</i> is a 
        massive mod project that was originally developed along two years and released in 2005. Due to its 
        scope, it is better described as an &quot;expansion pack mod&quot;&mdash; featuring 
        15 revamped maps from the best available in the community, two new &quot;Boss 
        songs&quot; for each faction (including an amazing intro score created by and authorized by 
        C&amp;C composing legend Frank Klepacki), tons of new abilities, and 
        entirely new tech buildings. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Following the success of Command &amp; Conquer Generals, Electronic 
        Arts released the Zero Hour expansion, featuring 9 Generals based on 
        the initial three factions: USA, China, and the terrorist organization 
        known as GLA (Global Liberation Army). 
        These Generals specialized in specific areas, such as infantry, 
        air, or tank units. Gameplay-wise, Boss Generals works as a 
        &quot;specialty generals blender&quot;&mdash;reuniting these specialized 
        styles into 3 &quot;Boss Generals&quot; who must earn General Points in battle to 
        unlock special units and powers until achieving the ultimate dream army: 
        the Boss Army. This is achieved through the innovative <b>Genplan</b> system -  
        instead of granting full power from the start, players the initial General Point 
        to define their starting army style, adapting and improving their 
        forces as the match progresses to counter their opponent's strategy. 
        Unlike conservative approaches in other games, that might only grant a single 
        bonus unit, the Genplan system redefines the faction on a deep level, 
        trading away certain basic units in exchange for the specialized power chosen.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Using the USA as an example, you can focus on heavy air power by picking the King Raptor 
        Genplan, or opt for a strong ground start with the Laser Paladin Genplan. 
        If you choose the King Raptor, you won't have access to tanks and vice-versa. 
        It's a tough choice, and what makes it truly interesting is that your opponent 
        cannot <b>know</b> which Genplan you picked initially. This adds a layer of 
        complexity and excitement to team games, vastly increasing replayability.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        This is the biggest gameplay innovation in Boss Generals &mdash; never before 
        in an RTS have you played something so similar to a game of cards. You don't 
        know which &quot;card&quot; your opponent has played, and failing to pick a card 
        yourself will hinder your progress. If you pick a card that your opponent 
        can easily beat, you might not have time to recover. That's where the excitement 
        begins &mdash; but it doesn't stop there. As you earn points in battle, 
        you can mix Genplans to create powerful combos, such as Stealth-Toxin 
        Tunnel Networks, Laser Paladin Tanks with King Raptor air support, or 
        Nuclear Tanks with Attack Outposts. Instead of being limited to only 9 
        Generals, you have <b>21 flexible combinations</b> to tailor your own army.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        The counter system has also been refined in Boss Generals. For example, tank 
        fire is enhanced against anti-infantry vehicles, which in turn deal less 
        damage to tanks. This emphasizes unit mixing and micro-management skills, 
        discouraging &quot;unit spamming&quot; and rewarding tactical players, 
        who gets the upper hand in every engagement.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Another major highlight are the new Boss Hero Powers, available 
        to high-level Generals. These powers complement the faction's profile: 
        the US hero, Col. Burton, gains a new E-Shock Grenade launcher capable 
        of inflicting a massive EMP shock that can send even the heaviest vehicles flying. 
        The GLA hero, Jarmen Kell, uses the &quot;Demoralizer&quot;&mdash; a long-range 
        flare launcher that marks a location for a plane to drop enemy prisoners 
        (alive, but <i>without</i> parachutes). This horrifying display severely 
        deteriorates enemy performance for a time, perfect for breaking through 
        heavy defenses. China's Black Lotus is deadlier than ever with her new 
        'Seduce' ability, allowing her to hijack enemy vehicles by seducing the 
        pilot and potentially turning the tide of war in China's favor.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        During Boss Generals intense development period, we 
        kept the project low-profile while we worked to ensure a professional level of polish. 
        The beta-testing process has been extensive, involving select top players from 
        the very early stages. We held weekly LAN testing sessions for 
        months with experienced players and co-designers I had collaborated with 
        for nearly a decade. Additionally, a massive 32-player LAN event in Hungary, 
        hosted by Gaspara, tested the Boss 0.99 Pre-release version. The feedback 
        was excellent &mdash; players loved the gameplay combinations and new powers, 
        and the build was remarkably stable with no bugs or desync errors.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        Among the 15 new maps, several are standouts. <i>Boss Tournament Green</i> is a 
        remake of Tournament Desert, adding a more open, grassy theme to the most 
        played C&amp;C Generals map of all time. Fallen Empire Remix is an 
        innovative map for 4 to 6 players, designed to suit both 2v2 and 3v3 matches 
        with protected rear bases that encourage strategic support via 
        air units and technology weapons.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        With a refined counter system, deeper strategy, 15 new maps, and a 
        wealth of new abilities, we are confident you will find plenty to 
        enjoy in Boss Generals.</font></p>
