              For the terrorism-general that loves being sneaky and scaring his 
              opponent with camouflage tactics, this is the genplan of choice. 
              It enables to the sneaky general the Stealth Hijacker, the Sabotage 
              plans upgrade, camo netting and the Toxin Marauder's decoy upgrade. 
              <i>Sabotage Plans</i> enables two infantry abilities: Hijacker's 
              become enabled to subvert an enemy structure to the terror organization, 
              and rebels receive booby trap equipments. Camo netting is free and 
              automatic for the stinger sites and network tunnels, and for all 
              other structures is also cheaper, costing only $300. The Fake Command 
              Center and Black Market are only buildable with this genplan, and 
              can't be turned into their real counterparts - instead, they are 
              manual-activated bombs of huge range and power. The Decoy Marauder 
              upgrade is purchased per tank, costs $200 and lasts for 40 secs; 
              It's a wire-controlled clone that always follows its spawner, excellent 
              to confuse and drag enemy fire, since it only has a couple side 
              airbags of difference to a real Toxin Mara. Although it has no real 
              damage output, the Decoy Marauder also fakes firing to enhance the 
              illusion effect, and is being considered by the enemies the low 
              tech GLA response for missile evasion. The Toxin Marauder must be 
              unlocked by the Toxin Weapons genplan.</p>

              If Toxin Tunnels and Toxin Marauders are the toys that most turn 
              you on, search no more! Costing slightly more than a normal tunnel 
              ($900 vs $800), the improved Toxin Tunnels can be turned into the 
              amazing stealth-toxin Tunnels that only Boss GLA has, with the stacking 
              of the Stealth Tactics genplan as soon as you have enough battle 
              experience to unlock all that power. One important thing to notice 
              is that Toxin Tunnels do NOT require a barracks, being excellent 
              for rushes. The Toxin Marauder comes with standard Toxin Shells, 
              and gets a sensible reload increase with the Toxin Reloader upgrade.</p>
            <p><font color="#FFFF00">Technical Details:</font><br>
              - Toxin Tunnel costs $900, builds in 32s (game time, vs 30 or standard

              - Toxin Tunnel doesn't require a barracks to be built <br>

              - 2 arms dealers, 2 forward tunnels, 2 ToxMaras - The dreaded 'Scrap 
              Rush'. Objective is killing the defending tanks with the RPGs from 
              the tunnels and picking the scraps with the Tox Maras to quickly 
              achieve base-leveling firepower.<br>
              - 4 workers + 4 forward tunnels - Fastest GLA rush, and one of the 
              hardest to stop. Workers build toxin tunnels on various different 
              points and use the earned RPGs to pressure the opponent, with more 
              tunnels being built meanwhile. Be warned: Critical cash rush.</p>

              No terror, no toxins, just good'ol blow-em-away style! That's the 
              chant of the Demo Tools GLA genplan, that makes the feared terror 
              bike available to the player, as well as the scud launcher and the 
              Scorpion and its demo rocket upgrade. Scuds take advantage of the 
              MAPATs upgrade, and after picking scrap upgrades (which can be achieve 
              by the crate drop general power), scud launcher missiles become 
              incredibly resistant to anti-missile measures. Double-scrapped Scuds 
              also receive a new demolition scud missile, extremely effective 
              against structures. Demo Terror is a supply stash's $500 upgrade 
              available only to the demolition-loving general, and adds nothing 
              less than 35% extra power to terrorists, and a whole whooping 50% 
              extra damage to gamma terrorists, meaning you won't wanna stop using 
              and upgrading them as the battle progresses and opponents get more 
              prepared. Demo Terror also improves terrorist-bike damage, and the 
              Gamma upgrade improves it even more. The &quot;suicide demo&quot; 
              upgraded bike has the highest damage, overlapping all previous damage 
              increases - impressive 1000 hitpoints of damage, which in practice 
              means that 2 suicide demo terrorbikes can destroy a War Factory.</p>

              - 2 arms dealers, 4 scorpion tanks, Scorpion Rocket - Traditional 
              'Scorpion Sting'. Scorpions are pumped continuously and quickly 
              hit and run on multiple fronts, taking advantage of the scorpion 
              superior speed and micromanaging the scorpion rockets to kill defending 
              infantry. <br>
              - 2 scorpion tanks, 2 terror bikes - Idea is luring opponent into 
              going after the scorpions, while the terror bikes kill his dozers 
              or power plant, delaying him down. Scorpion rocket is delayed, continuous 
              terrorbike-pumping is key.<br>
              - 2 forward tunnels and two barracks - 'Molotov rush'. Barracks 
              continuously pump rebels which are immediately equipped with molotov 
              cocktails, RPGs target incoming vehicles while rebels are switched 
              between molotov and toxingun to kill enemy infantry and structures<br>
              - Demo Terror + 2 barracks + 2 technicals + 8 terrorists - Hard 
              to execute but very effective, technicals invade at the same time 
              from two different sides and try reaching key enemy structures, 
              specially cash, wiping them out.</p>

These special drop crates take longer before disappearing, and give weapon upgrades (up to two levels depending on the unit), or if the unit is already with maximum weapon a experience upgrade (up to heroic), and if totally maxed out gives roughly $200 in cash. With a total of 8 crate boxes dropped by each support plane, it's easy to get, eg. 2 elite double-turret marauders, or 2 double-turret marauders and 2 double-scrap quads, or 4 double-armored battlebuses, which make up for excellent additions to your army.
