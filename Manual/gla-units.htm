      <p>GLA's recent toxic bio-technology research results made the toxic power 
        increase surpass the toxic resistance of their own soldiers. A small price 
        to pay for the extra power, according to the Jackal. Boss GLA's basic 
        infantry, the toxin rebel, is therefore not entirely invulnerable to toxins, 
        but still highly resistant to it, and can as easily clean up garrissoned 
        structures as ever. Toxin rebels riding bikes instantly gain the gamma 
        upgrade to their beta weapon. Feeling the need for more artillery support 
        for his ground-only based forces, the Jackal equipped the Toxin Rebels 
        with Molotov Cocktails as soon as he aquires the demo tools science, with 
        a marginal cost per rebel. Although very innacurate, Molotov Cocktails 
        have a range similar to the China's Inferno Cannon, and deliver great 
        anti-structure damage, therefore completing the Toxin Rebels usefulness 
        - specially when camouflaged while moving across the battlefield or loaded 
        into a battlebus.</p>

        China secret agents, the RPG soldier weapon can be trained faster, meaning 
        a faster production. The real key to its extra power though, is the new 
        extra-resistance Gamma RPG missile, able to overload enemy PDL and ECM 
        protection devices to some extent. MAPATs technology has also evolved, 
        and now equips these portable missiles after upgraded, adding range and 
        power to the already devastating RPGs. You will *not* want to see a huge

        Intelligence reports that the external armor has been made lighter to 
        alleviate some of the new weight, which should render this new battlebus 
        version more vulnerable to infantry missiles and direct tank hits. Bear
