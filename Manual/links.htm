            <p>FluidPlay Studios is the game studio responsible for the Command 
              and Conquer Boss Generals creation and development. Headed by Breno 
              'MaDDoX' Azevedo, with almost 20 years on the road, it's most 
              probably the most experienced studio for RTS game projects still in 
              activity. You'll find top quality RTS modification projects there, 
              like the very successful HTAK (Hardcore TA:Kingdoms) and other new games 
              in development like<i> Total Atomic Power </i></p>

          <td width="70%">No one less than the Command and Conquer Series game 
            producers, not only a real legend in the industry, but also one that 
            makes up for its name. With big names like &quot;The Lord of the Rings(tm)&quot; 
            under their belt, it's hard to not recognize their strength and competence 
            in the game scene. Very good built-in modding architecture and tools, 
            added to some great modding support were key things that allowed such 
            a complex project like Boss Generals to become a reality.</td>
