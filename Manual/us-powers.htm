<p align="center" class="MaD-X"><font size="2">- Differently from normal Generals 
  points, that enable one power or extra unit, Boss Generals player's early strategy 
  is defined by his General Plan - &quot;Genplan&quot;. This first point will 
  enable upgrades, new units and different unit and structure behaviours, totally 
  changing the gameplay for both you, general, and your opponent - as soon as 
  he realizes which genplan you picked, which can be too late! Be warned that, 
  although you can save the early point to spend on a normal general point later 
  on, refusing to use the incredible power of the genplans since the very early 
  game may prove extremely hard and cost you games.</font></p>

      <p> The Assault genplan is the perfect opening strat for players who don't 
        like taking chances, enabling the Laser Paladin and the Delta Engine upgrade 
        for Tomahawks. The most technologically advanced MBT (Main Battle Tank) 
        ever created, the 'Laser Pally' is very hard to be countered early by 
        opponent forces due to its strong armor, attack power - in the form of 
        a laser cannon - and the ability to destroy incoming missiles with his 
        PDL (Point Defense Laser). Using it from the very beginning in an aggressive 
        fashion has the side effect of leaving you open for anti-air units economy 
        harrassment, and since Chinooks are so expensive and vulnerable, that's 
        something to bear in mind. Laser Paladin doesn't excel the original Paladin 
        only in raw firepower, once upgraded to composite armor it receives 50% 
        more resistance than the old model - something repeatedly requested by 
        Generals used to the - now obsolete - Crusader's composite endurance in 
        the battlefield. Delta engines make Tomahawks 30% faster, and a much more 
        versatile surgical strike weapon, able to quickly retreat when uncovered.</p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFF00">Technical Details:</font><br>
        - Laser Paladin buildcost $1,100<br>
		- Delta Engine cost $300 per Tomahawk, 30% more speed, faster turning
        - Composite Armor upgrade research cost $2,000, research time 60s (Strategy 
        Center)<br>
        - Laser Cannon damage per second 15% higher than the original Paladin</p>
      <p> <font color="#00FFFF">Combos:</font><br>
        - 2 Laser Paladins + 1 avenger - Excellent vs GLA using mass RPG or Scorpion 
        strats, beware Toxin Marauders and hijackers<br>
        - Laser Paladin + 1 flashvee - Good against China with Nuke-RPGs, flashbang 
        rangers transported in humvees do short work on them and are protected 
        by anti-inf by the paladin<br>
        - Laser Paladin + 1 comanche - Super versatile and powerful build, powerful

      <p> The genplan for those who like surprising and hitting from above, enabling 
        the anti-structure Jackhammer upgrade for Guardian Sentry Drones, the 
        Advanced Countermeasures upgrade and the world-renounmned King Raptor 
        fighter. As much as enemy air and anti-air technology improved, the brute 
        force and resiliance of King Raptors are almost impossible to be questioned. 
        Unfortunately, the super-fast original PDL rate of fire couldn't be achieved 
        after the original design project was destroyed during a failed enemy 
        attempt of capturing it. Nevertheless, it still offers very good anti-missile 
        protection, and the new design received a special, more bullet-resistant 
        armor after being upgraded to countermeasures. The missile firing system 
        has been optimized with faster missiles that although not as precise as 
        the EP ones, rarely if ever misfire as their predecessors. The heavier 
        missile resulted in less missiles being loaded at once on the aircraft, 
        to keep the weight low and the performance high, but after many tests 
        US engineering achieved a final damage output equal to the original specs, 
        when the laser-guided missile technology is upgraded at the airfields. 
        Advanced Countermeasures also solidly improve the resistance of Comanches 
        and King Raptors versus anti-air threats, making them excellent options 
        even for early game.</p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFF00">Technical Details:</font><br>
        - King Raptor buildcost $1400<br>
        - Advanced Countermeasures upgrade research cost is $600, research time 
        40s (Airfield), provides special armor for the King Raptor and Comanche<br>
		- JackHammer upgrade for GSDs cost $250 per drone, research time 8 secs<br>
        - LGM (Laser Guided Missiles) upgrade research cost is $1,800, research 
        time 40s (Airfield)<br>
        - King Raptor fires 5 missiles (from 6), same damage per missile, with 
        LGM upgrade the final damage is the same as the original</p>

        and building planes in the other, for super-fast enemy main production 
        structures (eg. warfactory) destruction<br>
        - 1 airfield + 2 KRs + 1 Comanche - Strong air-superiority build, comanche 
        can be used to disrupt enemy tactical actions (eg. refinery capture) while 
        the 2 KRs are built and used to destroy the incoming AA vehicle<br>
        - 1 airfield + 2 barracks + 1 KR + 6 MDs - Balanced air build, Missile 
        defenders on both main flanks protect the airfield(s) that start massing 
        KRs<br>
        - 2 airfield + 3 KRs + 2 EP raptors - For the micro-management gifted

      <p>Tactical american generals are generally pleased to win their battles 
        using the most technological toys available to them, getting enemies with 
        pants down and many times with little to no time to react. If that's your 
        description, the 'Tech Devices' genplan is the right one for you. It enables 
        two multi-medal awarded designs of General Alexis, the EMP Patriot able 
        to disable enemy incoming vehicles and structures - having some specially 
        nasty aggressive usages - and the 'Power Surge' Control Rods, based on 
        the original Advanced Control Rods and able to deliver mass amounts of 
        power to the US base. Last but not least, allows the american General 
        to enhance his already powerful infantry with Missile Defenders veterancy 
        and the Speedboots upgrade, that affects missile defenders and pathfinders.</p>
      <p> <font color="#FFFF00">Technical Details:</font><br>
        - EMP Patriot cost $1,300, buildtime 30s (vs 25s of the standard patriot)<br>
        - Power Surge Control Rods - Free activation after normal control rods 
        research at fusion power plant<br>
        - Speedboots upgrade research cost $1000, research time 45s</p>
      <p> <font color="#00FFFF">Combos:</font><br>
        - Power Surge + 2 supply centers + 2 EMP patriot drops - The 'patriot 
        drop' which's the fastest rush tactic in the game, is incredibly maximized 
        by the Power Surge upgrade that powers two EMP patriots being built by 
        dozers at different spots of the enemy base<br>
        - 2 barracks + speedboots + 6 MDs - Harrassment opening. Speedboot being 
        researched at one barracks and veteran MDs being trained at the other 
        allows for a quickly assembled missile defender force that is able to 
        outrun most enemy threats and kill targets of oportunity like dozers and 
        supply trucks<br>
        - Flashbang + speedboots + 5 MDs + 2 rangers - Power-push strat. A great 
        complimentary frontal force that can kill almost anything thrown at it 
        early on, can be backed by a dozer intended to build a vertically progressing 
        column of EMP patriots</p>

      Stealth Bomber is also way faster and less vulnerable to Anti-air fire than 
      the Carpet Bomber plane, making sure the MOAB always obliterates the intended 
      target. With all that power comes a unique price tag, the MOAB is only available 
      to the highest experienced 7-star Generals, at a cost of two general points 
      - and takes 6 minutes to recharge. Still, the MOAB is the perfect choice 
      against a large clumping of opponent defenses and/or units, and there's 
      nothing quite as morale devastating to the enemy than its superiority-imposing 
      usage.</td>
