      <p> One of the latest advancements in standard American technology seen 
        on the battle field is the standard Laser Rifle which is extreamly strong 
        when fighting infantry and has had reports of even burning troops to death. 
        Nevertheless, the improved arsenal of Rangers do not stop there! New HP 
        (High Powered) flashbang grenades have been issued to troops on and off 
        the field. Tests show that with increased fire power and a longer reload 
        time Rangers will have to micro each of their new and improved weapons 
        for the best effect when neutralizing infantry threats.</p>

        American forces are receiving new gear if the commander invest on the 
        'Tech Devices' genplan and is willing to pay a small price tag for the 
        technology. Speed boots help American Missile Defenders and Pathfinders 
        to gain a substantially increased movement rate, making them exceptional 
        pursuing and defending units, able to outrun most of their foes. Quick 
        response teams have been seen using hummers, speed boots and the search 
        and destroy orders to make quick work of flanking armor support. It's 
        worth noting that when the general picks the &quot;Tech Devices&quot; 
        genplan, all missile defenders start out with veteran status, hence with 
        a higher damage and resistance.</p>

        with the laser rangers rifles that deal a good deal of damage on structures

        as the strategy center is built. Like other fast moving troop-carrying 
        vehicles, though, the humvee is much more susceptible to tank fire recently,

        the former versions failed, the Guardian Sentry Drone excels with a new 
        plated armor that is gattling-fire resistant. A small long-range machinegun 
        is now standard on all GSDs, which has the latest AI enhancements of not 
        firing unless put into its guard mode. Field tests including a combination 
        of Avenger and sentry drone has proven to make the unit extremely effective

      efficient against structures. To activate the system properly, just one 
      Tomahawk should aim at the target, and the tomahawks nearby will automatically 
      fire at it using siege missiles. When equipped with the new &quot;Delta 
      Engine&quot; upgrade, available with the <i>Assault</i> genplan, the Tomahawk

        claims of the high US command which's comprised of seasoned american Generals, 
        the EP rockets that arm the new plane not only now have an improved guidance 
        system that makes them never miss targets - even small and moving ones 
        like infantry - but they're also plated with a special titanium light 
        metal compound (A-6 Titanium Aluminide alloy) that makes them double-resistant

      <p> The 'eagle' general's most loved weapon. As much as enemy air and anti-air 
        technology improved, the brute force and resiliance of King Raptors are 
        almost impossible to be questioned. Unfortunately, the super-fast original 
        PDL rate of fire couldn't be achieved after the original design project 
        was destroyed during a failed enemy attempt of capturing it. Nevertheless, 
        it still offers very good anti-missile protection, and the new design 
        received a special, more bullet-resistant armor after being upgraded to 
        countermeasures. The missile firing system has been optimized with faster 
        missiles that although not as precise as the EP ones, rarely if ever misfire 
        as their predecessors. The heavier missile resulted in less missiles being 
        loaded at once on the aircraft, to keep the weight low and the performance 
        high, but after many tests US engineering achieved a final damage output 
        equal to the original specs, after the laser-guided missile technology 
        is upgraded at the airfields.</p>

        to quickly destroy any standard stationary defense of the enemy. Albeit 
        not being very effective vs structures, in large maps it's smart having 
        a good number of stealth fighters for surgical missions. The bunker buster 
        upgrade also makes it extremely effective vs GLA, forcing units out of 
        the tunnels and killing the weaker infantry that's hidden within.</p>

        heard about the Aurora bomber too, claiming it wasn't accurate enough 
        to hit moving target and was therefore useless for early defense purposes. 
        EP bombs were then projected to help alleviate this issue, and a replacement 
        aircraft had to be designed with an advanced dropping mechanism to support 
        the new weapon. Mixed feelings resulted from the final product, since 
        the new EP Aurora bomber is now much more complex and therefore sensibly 
        slower to produce, and the lighter bomb used doesn't have as high raw 
        damage as the former one. Nevertheless the US high command felt it's a 
        more polished and useful aircraft than the former and adopted the EP Aurora 
        as the new standard bomber of the american forces.</p>
