      <p> <font size="2"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> - First, 
        I want to know what it is, period, and what it did in terms of modifying 
        things. 2nd, I want to know if it is balanced. 3rd, I want to know if 
        spam is an issue. 4th, I want to know if it is easily swapped in and out 
        of the game...</p>
      <font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> - Okay, 
      one thing at a time. 1st, Boss Generals is a wholy new gameplay mode for 
      Generals/Zero Hour, to fully understand what's it about read <a href="gameplay.htm">here</a>, 
      to know about the actual changes unit per unit, check <a href="bossarmies.htm">here</a>. 
      2nd - As far as our quality control guys and 8-month balance period could 
      check, yes. Nothing is expected to be perfect in an initial release, but 
      you'll most probably be surprised on how balanced it is, specially considering 
      the complex unit combinations in the Boss genplan system. 3rd - Simply put, 
      counters are much stronger than in the original game, so unit massing (spam) 
      problems are only an issue in late game, and that's still questionable coz 
      that's the moment when the uber-destruction powers kick in. 4th - yes, we 
      have an easy loader that does it all for you.</font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - How is the game pace compared to Generals and Zero Hour?</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Everyone who playtested it agrees that it has a &quot;feel&quot; and 
        pace similar to Generals - in a more brutal fashion - with even more diversity 
        and excitement than Zero Hour. Although the countering system is enhanced, 
        meaning that units are killed by their counters faster, similar Units 
        are generally made stronger to each other (like tank vs tank or artillery 
        vs artillery) what makes micromanagement battles last satisfyingly longer.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Is this going to be something of a race to the highest general level? 
        I don't want to play something where 1st-to-hit-5-wins.</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Boss is much more about tayloring the perfect army as the war progresses 
        than digging points for a fast, cheap win. For you to better understand, 
        we've fine tuned the experience gave by each army. So, for example, Boss 
        GLA is more expendable but their units give away less experience, Boss 
        US is the opposite. Since games generally last longer, that was essential. 
        So US take longer to reach its uberness &quot;Boss status&quot; (level 
        7), China faster, and GLA gets points the fastest.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Is it set up so that when you hit that gen level, you can suddenly rip 
        apart half of the opponent's base with your new toys...?</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Honestly, we've seen many more players investing *back* at basic genplans, 
        to improve mixing, than spending on the high-level &quot;free-kill&quot; 
        toys.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Example: You're china. You have a big slow-ass army of tanks, and buildings 
        with no real self defense. USA hits top level before you do, you have 
        every ability you already had and then some new boom booms to murder everything 
        better.</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Okay. Strongest &quot;boom-booms&quot; are obviously the carpet bomber 
        (China gets it faster, reloads faster), and the MOAB - which costs a whooping 
        two general points and takes 6 min to recharge. How did China let US get 
        all these points and not have theirs in the first place? ;) In our tests, 
        only in very long-drawn games (generally teams) someone ever reach Level 
        7. China gets the most help from points in actual gameplay, in terms of 
        time/efficiency, which sorts of compensate for its overall lack of mobility. 
        US points are the best, but generally kick in at the point when they're 
        very needed 'coz GLA spam and China combos, complimented by the almighty 
        Boss upgrades, already exceeded US firepower on pure cash/efficiency, 
        so US general powers work more as a balance thing. That considering similar 
        skill levels of course, a walkover will only be made quicker by Boss general 
        powers, sparing the victim from a too long suffering :D</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Does GLA have anything to break into an uber-turtled base?</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - First, the molotov cocktail upgrade for rebels. It rocks hard vs defense, 
        although it misses too much to replace RPGs for anti-tank. Second, demoralize. 
        It's devastating for the rate-of-fire of defenses, and the fire range 
        is huge. Third, crate drop plus scud launchers. Very powerful. Scrapped 
        or double-scrapped, they get increasingly resistant to PDL and ECM defensive 
        measures. Last but not least, Militia (an improved Angry mob) ambush is 
        very interesting. For late game, just imagine an angry mob but super powered 
        in your base when you don't expect it. It takes long to recharge (6 min) 
        but its units can be spread apart and even loaded into tunnels! It certainly 
        makes up for GLA not having a MOAB or some pinky lil' plane dropping bombs.</font></p>
      <font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - An angry mob ambush?? WTF?</font></span></font></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Militia ambush is interesting, but far from overpowered. Its units can 
        be spread apart, some of them have a short-range AA weapon and can be 
        loaded into tunnels, which enhance their effectiveness when coupled with 
        stealth tunnels or sneak attack tunnels. This is practically like a secondary 
        super weapon on its own. Still, it takes long to recharge (6 min) and 
        in any way you look at it, infantry is always very vulnerable to many 
        counters that are plentiful at late game.</font></p>

        - I want invisible toxin rebels with the demo upgrade. Can I have'em?</font></span></font></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Yeah you can have'em, but that's too shy.. how about: invisible-suicide-demo-toxin-molotov-rebels 
        :D That's the kind of sweet you can expect from Boss Gens.</font></p>
     <font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD">

        - How am I expected to defeat a mass of Stealthed Comanches with uber 
        laser monsters as armor backups?</font></span></font></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - First, you must look at the big picture. On the ground is very hard 
        for US handling a mass of Toxin Marauders or Nuke Battlemasters, for example, 
        it generally needs costly air or infantry support. As boosted as the comanches 
        are, they can't be stealthed until level 3 is reached, and by that time 
        China already have superior detection (Super Lotus and Gattling Emperors) 
        and detection for Boss GLA becomes very good, in the form of idle-stealthed 
        radar vans (with the camoufrage genpoint), and the Tech Saboteur. Tech 
        Sabs have good speed and huge line of sight and detection range. Also, 
        Boss stealth comanches take sensibly longer to re-cloak than the original, 
        while GLA Quads get Turbo-AP bullets upgrade (way faster firing rate) 
        and free scrap upgrades using the crate drop gen power.</font></p>
		     
      <font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Wait a moment here.. you mean you have King Raptors and Laser Paladins 
        in the same army? Are you crazy??</font></span></font></p>
      </font>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - For starters, you can't have both immediately. Each take one genplan 
        and you have to fight effectively to reach a higher rank and mix in another 
        genplan. At that time the opponent will have its own combo toys, like 
        fast-reload nuke Tank Hunters and stealthed stinger sites and toxin tunnels, 
        that makes things really complicated for the typical USA PDL abuser. You 
        also have to consider that Laser Paladins have a slow reload rate on its 
        turret, Avengers have a delay on its secondary PDL, and King Raptors have 
        a slower PDL rate than the original. All these small tidbits are hard 
        to notice separately, but they do stack up in balance's favour.</font></p>
		     
      <font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Ok, roll play: I am a no-rush camper player. How do i turtle up?</font></span></font></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - The best bet would be going a) GLA stealth with mass stingers and tunnels 
        + molotov cocktail rebel spam as soon as demo tools is achieved; or b) 
        US with tech devices for mass EMP patriots, flashbang for anti-infantry 
        then King Raptors when available.</font></p>
		     
      <font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - So what about China? How can a live in late game when the other sides 
        just pwned my INF bunker camp strat with scud bugs?</font></span></font></p>
      </font> 
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - The &quot;scud bug&quot; is fixed since Zero Hour's patch 1.02, and 
        Boss Generals share these fixes. As for China late game, a large mass 
        of fully upgraded battlemasters with some emperors or Helixes S2 for subliminal 
        messaging rate-of-fire increase is an absolute steamroller, and in the 
        air the fearsome Nuke-napalm Black Migs will make sure you have superior 
        support.</font></p>
		     
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - How is someone able to properly defend against a GLA that can be stealth 
        or toxin? There'll be no adaptation time..</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - The worst problem vs an early game Boss GLA is when he picks Stealth 
        Tactics. Stealth Hijackers can grab dozers (and, by quickly raising structures 
        remotely, steal the enemy technology) and also capture buildings with 
        the new &quot;Infiltration&quot; upgrade - if you're not prepared. Boss 
        USA starts with the spy drone, a general point for the older factions, 
        and radar scan, while Boss China have the brand new Advanced Speaker Tower, 
        that when upgraded to detection-EMP mines have a long detection range.<br>
        </font></p>
	
	     <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - What's the most cost-efficient unit for each army?</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - That's really dependant on the situation and genplan picked by each 
        army. For example, while scorpions are the most cost-effective unit early 
        game in tank vs tank battles, due to its anti-infantry and anti-armor 
        scorpion &quot;demo&quot; rocket, against USA PDL-enabled laser paladins 
        they're not half as effective - in this case Toxin Marauders are much 
        better.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - How is humvee with missile defenders (MDV) abuse handled in Boss Gens??</font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Like all other vehicles that carry troops able to fire on the move (battle 
        bus, outpost, troopcrawler), in Boss Generals humvees are extremely vulnerable 
        to tank fire, many times getting to red energy - therefore slowing down 
        dramatically - with a single shot. While ground range of anti-infantry 
        vehicles (Quad and Gattling) are improved (165 vs 150), and rate of fire 
        improvement upgrades are available for them (Turbo chaingun and Turbo 
        AP), the 'Search and Destroy' battleplan also has a slightly smaller effect, 
        making MDVs risky and ineffective to use as main battle units and more 
        adequate for harrassment and missile-support roles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><span class="MaD-X"><font size="2"><font color="#FFFF00"><b><font color="EEEE66">Q</font></b></font> 
        - Are busses g** in Boss?? <font size="1"><i>(Question by Aggro)</i></font></font></span></font></p>
      <p><font face="verdana" size="2" color="DDDDDD"><font color="#00FF00"><b><font color="#00CC00">A</font></b></font> 
        - Not when just-born.. you need destroyed-vehicle scraps to have them 
        &quot;g**&quot; lol :D. Un-scrapped they die easily to tank fire in Boss 
        Gens, and they're also slower than the original version.</font></p>
