Thanks for downloading my latest map, A Path Beyond 3!

As most of you know, this map is a remake of the map "A Path Beyond" 
from the original Red Alert. This was also my favourite map from
Red Alert. Basically, I recreated it and added a few buildings to
garrison. I also added waves at the beach areas. Like the original map,
this map is for a max of 4 players. It works well for both team play
and FFA games. The setting is temperate, it takes place during evening.
(Notice the slightly reddish/orange lighting)

This map comes complete with fully tested and working AI (tested all
12 factions in every starting spot) and waves at the beach areas.

Again, thx for downloading my latest map, enjoy!
