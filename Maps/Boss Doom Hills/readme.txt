*** Introduction: The 'Pro Series' Map Set has been designed to offer advanced map designs for Pro Players to battle on, respecting many criterias demanded by top players like fast paced gameplay, many different tactical options and a balanced layout. The Pro Series maps are professionally designed from the ground up and get input from many renowned top players of different factions, getting their layouts twisted according to the players requests and suggestions.

*** Description: Doom Hills is a "country" style map, inspired in the Brazilian northeast natural environment and conceived as a fast and furious background for 1 on 1 games. All tech structures (refineries, repair and reinforcement pads) are indestructible forcing the players to actually fight to acquire/regain their control instead of just destroying them. The repair pads once captured allow vehicles to repair there, like a warfactory and reducing the need for base retreats. Although the bases are reasonably protected, they're very close together the frontal access is large and the back area close to the natural expansions are large enough and makes some tricks easy, like using anti-air units to trap US chinooks or building unsuspecting tunnels or sending an artillery force for base background pounding. There are also some very good uses for GLA bikes and artillery units in the middle natural obstacles. 

*** Install Instruction: Simply Unzip the file in your <My Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour Data\Maps> directory, create it if you don't have any third party map yet.
