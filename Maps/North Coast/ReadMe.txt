North Coast

by spyVspy


A four player skirmish/mutliplayer map for Zero Hour.  

Set on the Pacific coast near a tiny town on the cliffs.  The terrain varies from beach and cliffs to rolling hills and wooded slopes.  Two start positions are by the coast and two are up in the hills. Map is assymetrical.  The base areas are large with multiple ways to enter.  Lots of supplies scattered around the map. There are a couple tech structures to capture but no oil.
