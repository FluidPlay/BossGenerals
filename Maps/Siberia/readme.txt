*** Introduction: The 'Pro Series' Map Set has been designed to offer advanced map designs for Pro Players to battle on, respecting many criterias demanded by top players like fast paced gameplay, many different tactical options and a balanced layout. The Pro Series maps are professionally designed from the ground up and get input of many renowned top players of different factions, getting their layouts twisted according to their requests and suggestions.

*** Description: Siberia is a vast frozen desert in Asia, known by its frozen forests, rigid climate conditions and cities that got abandoned due to the extreme harsh conditions. It's exactly after these concepts that this map was designed, a winter style map, conceived as a large armies background for massive wars in 3v3 play. All tech structures (refineries, repair and reinforcement pads) are indestructible forcing the players to actually fight to acquire/regain their control instead of just destroying them. The repair pads once captured allow vehicles to repair there, like a warfactory and reducing the need for base retreats. The rocky pathways and areas are unaccessile by vehicles, only by infantry and bikes. Notice the two frozen forest areas have middle open spots that have some interesting uses - not only you can hit and retreat with infantry there for traps, but you can also have a tunnel built there or drop artillery units assuring you control of the area.
